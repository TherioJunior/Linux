#### What changes have been made
  - It's a almost fully rewritten theme for the fish shell. It's based on the [bira theme for fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/theme-bira).
  - The git directory checks have been copied from bira, other than that the whole design is based off the [darkblood zsh theme](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/darkblood.zsh-theme).
  - Fixed for Arch Linux since the hostname function of fish doesn't work here, replaced it with cat /etc/hostname.
