# Issues I have encountered so far.

List of issues I have encountered so far on my Arch linux install.

#### **14.05.2022**:
> After updating NVIDIA graphics drivers to "nvidia 515.43.04-2" (or, alternatively "nvidia-dkms-515.43.04-1") on an NVIDIA GTX 980 Ti, OBS stopped working.

#### **15.05.2022**:
> Freedesktop patch arrived. OBS is working again.

#### **23.05.2022**:
> Issue wasn't on my main PC, but on my laptop. After around 2 days of not rebooting or shutting down and only closing the lid, KDE had an OpenGL version detection crash which I had to reenable per hand and then reboot. The issues this error caused was that the compositor wasn't working anymore. Laptop was fairly old (Model: HP 625)
