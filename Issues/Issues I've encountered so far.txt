List of issues I have encountered so far on my Arch linux install.

> 14.02.2022:
>> After updating NVIDIA graphics drivers to "nvidia 515.43.04-2" (or, alternatively "nvidia-dkms-515.43.04-1") on an NVIDIA GTX 980 Ti, OBS stopped working.

> 15.02.2022:
>> Freedesktop patch arrived. OBS is working again.
